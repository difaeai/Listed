// Flows will be imported for their side effects in this file.
// This ensures Genkit discovers and registers them during development or build.

// Example:
// import './flows/example-flow'; // Assuming you create flows in a 'flows' subdirectory
import './flows/improve-summary-flow';
import './flows/chatbot-flow';
